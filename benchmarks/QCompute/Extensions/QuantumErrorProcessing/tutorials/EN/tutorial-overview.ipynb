    "## About QEP\n",
    "\n",
    "**QEP** is a **Q**uantum **E**rror **P**rocessing toolkit developed by the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com/) at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/). QEP aims to deal with quantum errors inherent in quantum devices using software solutions. Currently, it offers four powerful quantum error processing functions: performance evaluation, quantum error characterization, quantum error mitigation, and quantum error correction:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Performance Evaluation** is used for assessing the capabilities and extendibilities of\n",
    "  quantum computing hardware platforms, through estimating the error rates of quantum states,\n",
    "  quantum gates, and quantum measurement apparatus. It provides\n",
    "  standard randomized benchmarking, interleaved randomized benchmarking, cross-entropy\n",
    "  benchmarking, unitarity randomized benchmarking, direct fidelity estimation, and\n",
    "  cross-platform fidelity estimation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Quantum Error Characterization** is used for reconstructing the comprehensive information in\n",
    "  quantum computing hardware platforms, through many partial and limited experimental results.\n",
    "  It provides quantum state tomography, quantum process tomography, quantum detector tomography,\n",
    "  quantum gateset tomography, and spectral quantum tomography.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Quantum Error Mitigation** is used for improving the accuracy of quantum computational\n",
    "  results, through post-processing the experiment data obtained by varying noisy experiments,\n",
    "  extending the computational reach of a noisy superconducting quantum processor.  It provides\n",
    "  zero-noise extrapolation technique to mitigate quantum gate noise, and a collection of methods\n",
    "  such as inverse, least-square, iterative Bayesian unfolding, Neumann series to mitigate quantum measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Quantum Error Correction** is used to protect quantum information from errors due to\n",
    "  environmental noise and imperfections in hardware. Quantum computers rely on the delicate\n",
    "  properties of quantum systems, which are susceptible to errors, and thus, QEC has become an\n",
    "  essential tool for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. It provides a simulator that\n",
    "  can simulate error correction codes based on the stabilizer formalism, allowing users to study\n",
    "  the effects of various types of noise, assess the performance of different error correction codes, and evaluate the robustness of quantum algorithms to errors."
